# Code challenge

So you made it to the Code Challenge ðŸ¥³

## What we are building

The app we are building is fairly simple and open-ended for you to make the decisions.

### The requirements are the following:

Use the dummy data from `/dummyData/applications.json` (this is 1:1 application data as we actually ingest from typeform, though with generated fake data)

1. Create a page rendering a list of restaurants.
2. From each of the restaurant's, the user should be able to select one restaurant which navigates to a list of applications belonging to that specfic restaurant.
3. Selecting an application from the list should display a profile of that applicant (also from the dummy data set).
4. There should be an indicator of if the user has not already viewed the applicant profile.

- BONUS: The user will be able to navigate between profiles by swiping

## Prerequisites

- The Project is bootstrapped with [The Official Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript) please refer to that id you have any issues.
- NodeJs installed
- Android and/or iOS environment (refer to [the docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) if needed)
- We will use Expo to make the setup easy.

## Setup

- It should work out of the box `npm install -g expo-cli` (if you don't have it already)
- `npm install`
- `yarn ios` & `yarn start` (for iOS)
- `yarn android` & `yarn start` (for Android)

## Expectations

So we expect an app that would work like the mentioned in the top of the description.

We will evaluate it on the following:

- How you structure your project(s),
- How you decide to parse the application (and why?)
- If the application fulfills the 4 use cases
- Quality of the code (readability, structure, etc.)
- Explainations and considerations for the solutions
- Use of react concepts
- If we can actually run the full project solution

We will **NOT** evaluate it on the following:

- Design (UI)
- Tests (though it would be cool, but not required at all)
- Time spent on the solution
